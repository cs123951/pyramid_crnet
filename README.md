This is official code for paper:

Pyramid Convolutional Recurrent Network for Serial Medical Image Registration With Adaptive Motion Regularizationsn

I have provided the implementation of network structure and guided filtering, and through `python test_inputs_outputs.py`, it is possible to directly run and test a network initialized with random parameters. I haven't provided the information about the loss function and stitching displacement field yet, but it doesn't affect understanding of the entire paper.

If you have any questions or bugs, please feel free to leave a message on the Issues.
